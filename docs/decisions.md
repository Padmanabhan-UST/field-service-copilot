# Design decisions

Short records of why each choice was made. Format: context, decision, alternatives rejected.

## 001: Keyless authentication
- **Context:** The app calls Foundry models and Azure AI services.
- **Decision:** Microsoft Entra ID via DefaultAzureCredential locally and managed identity when deployed, with least-privilege data roles (Azure AI User).
- **Rejected:** API keys in config (secret sprawl); Key Vault-stored keys (still a secret to rotate); Contributor role (too broad).

## 002: Standard deployments over provisioned throughput
- **Context:** Low, bursty POC traffic on a budget.
- **Decision:** Standard / Global Standard deployments.
- **Rejected:** Provisioned throughput (reserved capacity is billed continuously; suited to steady production load needing predictable latency).
